# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis I was tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members with a paid Amazon Vine membership.  The Amazon Vine program provides manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.  Companies pay a small fee to Amazon to utilize this service.  In this analysis, I chose the shoe review dataset from Amazon.  From this dataset, I used PySpark to perform ETL in order to determine if the paid Vine customers reviews were biased.

## Results
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
 There were total of 1,079,287 Vine reviews.
